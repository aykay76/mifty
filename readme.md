# MIFTY (Mine Is Faster Than Yours)
## It's really... nifty...

It crossed my mind that after 27 years (on and off) of programming various protocols and distributed systems, i've never actually developed a DNS client/server/resolver/forwarder. I'm bored and figured, why not?!

DNS is at the root of everything and without it we would have no internet as you know it, so it's good to understand how it works. Plus I saw a thing about "faster than light" DNS and was triggered - can I make the fastest DNS "thing" but also make it cross platform?

And so another sideline project was born...

I have the basic understanding of how DNS works, so the question now is how this project will evolve. I could make a sinkhole kind of project where I eliminate the naughties, or turn this into what DNS has always been; a distributed key/value database. Or maybe it will become something else entirely, or just become another unfinished project :)
